## Bus Replacement Prototype - React Native App 

Sound interesting? Follow these steps below:

1. Clone the git repository and access as you'd like (I use Github desktop and VScode from there)

2. npm install (in correct local directory)

3. npx expo start (as above)

4. To check out expo commands: npx expo -h

Good luck! 😃
